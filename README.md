Building a ChatGPT App with Retrieval Augmented Generation using Stream.io

In this project, I have created a ChatGPT app clone using Streamlit. I have then added retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to the basic ChatGPT application which will read pdf and docx file and than user can perform questin and answer based on that pdf / word file.

Used LangChain orchestrators to incorporate the RAG component into ChatGPT app.
